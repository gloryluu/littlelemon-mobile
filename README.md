# littlelemon-mobile

## Overview
For this assignment, you will create a simple app in React Native that allows users to sign up for the Little Lemon newsletter to ensure that they always get the latest updates from the restaurant.

This task will entail creating two screens and setting up a visual layout with core components such as Text, Image and View, configuring some TextInput and Pressable components that the user can interact with, and setting up React Navigation so that users can move between screens.

You are encouraged to apply all the skills that you acquired during this course, and you can revisit the previous course materials as needed if you need to refresh your knowledge or find some inspiration.
